# Main process, git and the risky parts

## Staging, and the patch surgery

Gitty stages; it does not commit. The message is written by an agent, so a
subject/body box would solve a problem nobody has — what is missing is a place
to decide *which changes are one commit*, which is what the four panes are for.
**Send** types a command into the terminal pane and stops there: no model is
called from inside the app, which is what keeps "nothing leaves the machine"
true. It sits in the **terminal pane's** header, beside the splits, because the
shell it types into is the one thing it touches — the files it talks about are
elsewhere, but the effect is here. The command is picked from the dropdown
beside the button — remembered commands, plus a prompt for one not remembered
yet — and there is deliberately no settings row for it: it is answered once per hand-over, not once per install.
`prefs.ts` owns the list (`gitty.agentCommands`, most recently used first) and a
command joins it by having been run, never by having been typed. **The head of
that list is the current command** — there is no second stored answer to drift
out of it, which is what an earlier `gitty.agentCommand` was — so the picker
shows `agentCommands[0]`, and an empty list greys both controls out. Forgetting
one goes through the main process (`settings:confirmForget`), so the
confirmation is a native modal the window cannot be clicked past — the same
reason discarding a file asks there rather than in the renderer.

`src/main/patch.ts` is the whole of the risky part, and it is pure string work
over `git diff` output so `test/patch.test.ts` can hold it — a wrong patch does
not throw, it writes a wrong index silently. Four rules, and the first is the
one that is easy to get backwards:

- **The direction decides which unselected lines are dropped and which become
  context.** Staging applies to the index against the *a* side, so an
  unselected `-` line is still there (context) and an unselected `+` line never
  was (dropped). Unstaging applies the cached diff in reverse against the *b*
  side, so it is the other way round.
- Only the pre-image side's `@@` position is exact; the other one moves by the
  net line delta of the hunks emitted before it in the same patch.
- A `\ No newline at end of file` marker travels with the line it describes and
  is dropped when that line is.
- Hunk counts are recomputed from the lines that survived, never carried over.

`git.applyHunks` fetches the patch itself, with the **same context count the
pane drew**, or the hunk the user clicked is not the hunk that gets staged.
`--unidiff-zero` is added only at context 0. Hunk staging is withdrawn entirely
while **Ignore whitespace** is on: that diff does not hold every change it would
apply. The UI offers it only for a single tracked file's diff, where the
displayed patch *is* `git diff -- <path>`; a whole-work-tree diff is against
HEAD and merges both sides.

## Searching, and the graph

Three reads that share the log's machinery. The filter box has a
`LogFilterMode`: message/author as before, or git's pickaxe (`-S` literal,
`-G` regex) over the diffs. Every expression git is given is an extended one
(`--extended-regexp`), git's own default being POSIX basic, where `a|b` is
literal text — the box is typed in what the rest of the world calls a regular
expression. Those walk the whole history, so `searchLog` keeps
one child process per root **per kind** — a grep must not cancel the log — and
kills the previous one instead of letting it finish for a reader who has moved
on. Every pattern is an array element, never text in a command line.

`git grep` and `git log -L` open as documents beside the diff (`FileDocState`
kinds `grep` and `lines`), so they inherit the find strip and the doc tabs. A
grep follows the revision on screen, which is the point of it: in a snapshot it
answers about the snapshot.

What the search box takes is a **query**, not a pattern: `foo in:*.py`, the
shape a mail client taught everyone. `src/shared/query.ts` parses it into terms
(`--and`-ed, `-foo` negated) and pathspecs (`-in:` becoming `:(exclude)`), and
is pure string work with no imports for the reason `patch.ts` is — a query read
wrongly searches the wrong thing silently, so `test/query.test.ts` holds it. It
is *shared* rather than main's because both sides read the box: main builds the
command line, the renderer asks whether there is a term in it at all and refuses
to run `in:*.py` alone. Two rules the parse is built around. **Quoting turns
every operator off**, which is the only way to search for `in:` or a leading
dash literally. And a bare `in` is the operator **only when a path follows**
(`looksLikePath`) — code is full of `for x in list`, and eating that word would
be a worse bug than not supporting the colon-less form at all.

`src/renderer/src/lanes.ts` computes the commit graph — deliberately not by
parsing `git log --graph`, whose ASCII is typeset for a terminal. A lane holds
the hash it expects next; a commit takes the first lane expecting it or opens
one; its first parent stays, the others take lanes of their own. The layout is
recomputed over the whole loaded list rather than continued from a saved state
at the page boundary: it is a left-to-right fold, so the first 300 rows come
out identical when the next 300 arrive, which is the property paging needs and
is cheaper than keeping boundary state right. `test/lanes.test.ts` pins that.

## Git access

`src/main/git.ts` shells out to `git` via `execFile` — no git library. Parsing
relies on NUL-separated machine formats (`status --porcelain=v2 -z`,
`--name-status -z`, `ls-tree -z`) so paths with spaces and renames survive;
rename records carry an extra NUL field, which is why those loops advance the
index by hand. Diffs above 2 MB are truncated with a notice rather than sent
whole. Whatever `git` is on `PATH` is what the app shows.

`push` / `pull` go through `remoteOp`, which is deliberately non-interactive:
`GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`, empty `GIT_ASKPASS` / `SSH_ASKPASS`, `ssh -o
BatchMode=yes` and a two-minute timeout. There is no terminal behind an
`execFile`, so a credential or passphrase prompt would block forever with
nowhere to appear. For the same reason it returns `{ ok, output }` rather than
throwing — the pane shows git's own words, and anything needing an answer is
finished in the terminal pane. `pull` is `--ff-only`: a merge that needs a
decision or an editor is not something a button should start.

Diverged branches are the one pull failure that gets an offer rather than a
report. The `git:pull` handler matches git's own words with `pullNeedsRebase`
— `remoteOp` runs under `LC_ALL=C`, so they are in English — and asks natively
whether to rebase, the dialog modal to the window the way discarding's is. Yes
re-runs `pull --rebase`, which replays the local commits and, unlike a merge,
opens no editor; no returns the original failure, and the strip shows what git
first said. Everything else — credentials, the network, a dirty work tree the
rebase then refuses — stays a report.

`submodulePull` is the third caller of `remoteOp`: `submodule update --init
--remote -- <path>`. `--remote` is what makes the file tree's item a *pull* —
the submodule moves to the tip of the branch it tracks rather than to the
commit the superproject records, and the superproject is left pointing at the
old one, so the pull shows up in Changes and committing the new pointer stays
the user's decision. `--init` covers a submodule that was never checked out,
which is the other thing "get me this one" can mean. Which paths are submodules
is read by `submodules` from `.gitmodules` with one `git config -f .gitmodules
--get-regexp` — the alternative, `ls-files --stage`, names every file in the
repository to find the handful with mode 160000. No `.gitmodules` makes git
exit non-zero, which is the empty list rather than an error.

## The local web server

`src/main/web.ts` serves commits as plain HTML, and binding `127.0.0.1` is not
on its own a boundary: it keeps other machines out, not other pages in this
machine's browser, any of which can fetch the port — and behind it is every
open repository's contents. So every URL carries a token minted at startup,
as a path prefix (`/t/<token>/…`) rather than a query string. A wrong token is
a **404, not a 403** — a 403 confirms the resource exists. The `Host` header
must be loopback, which makes DNS rebinding pointless. And `Referrer-Policy:
no-referrer` is required: the pages link outward, and one click would otherwise
put the token in a stranger's `Referer`.

## The remote's own pages

`src/main/remote.ts` turns a remote URL into the prefix a commit hash is
appended to, so the commit menu can offer **Open Remote URL** beside the local
server's page, and <kbd>Ctrl/Cmd+Click</kbd> on a commit row to open it without
the menu — the base is read once per root in `RepoTab`, so the click is local.
It is inference and says so: no protocol asks a remote where its
commit pages are, so an address that cannot be named comes back null and the
menu item is simply absent — a repository with no remote, a `file://` remote, a
Windows drive letter mistaken for a host, or Azure DevOps, whose commit page is
not derivable from the remote path.

Everything else is a two-branch rule: GitLab keeps its non-file routes under
`/-/`, Bitbucket says `commits`, and GitHub, Gitea, Forgejo, Codeberg, Gogs and
sourcehut all say `/commit/<hash>` — which is what an unrecognised host is given
too, self-hosted Gitea and Forgejo being common and carrying no name to match
on. `git.ts` picks the remote the current branch tracks, else `origin`, else
the first one configured; the parsing is pure string work with no repository
behind it, and `test/remote.test.ts` is the list of forms that must keep
working.

A bare host (`git@github:user/repo.git`) is an ssh config alias: git stores it
verbatim, so `remote.ts` expands it through the user's `~/.ssh/config`
(`src/main/sshconfig.ts`, parsed at most once per file change) before the
layout branch, falling back to well-known names (`github` → `github.com`) when
there is no config. A `HostName` of `ssh.<domain>` is a transport endpoint, not
the site, and loses the `ssh.` prefix; a dotted host is never expanded, because
the remote keeps the real hostname in the common `Host github.com` → `HostName
ssh.github.com` SSH-over-443 setup. An internal host that merely contains a
well-known name is left alone.

The resolution is remembered per repository (`src/main/remoteCache.ts`,
`userData/remote-cache.json`), so reopening a repository reuses the answer
after one `git remote get-url` check plus a fingerprint that the ssh config has
not changed — the fingerprint is what makes an edited config invalidate the
remembered host, and a moved or renamed remote fails the URL check. Known
limits: a branch whose upstream moves to a different remote while the app is
open keeps the remembered base until a recompute is forced, and `Include`
directives are not followed.

## Gource

`src/main/gource.ts` is an *optional* companion, and the shape follows from
that: `available()` walks `PATH` once (cached — PATH does not change under a
running app) and the commits pane simply does not render the button when it
comes back false, rather than showing one that fails on click.

`play()` spawns it detached and resolves after a 2.5 s grace period: long
enough to catch the immediate failures (no display, no OpenGL, an unreadable
path) and report gource's own stderr through the same strip push and pull use,
short enough that the button does not feel stuck. If it is still alive when the
timer fires, its pipes are destroyed and it is `unref`'d — gource draws its own
window and is meant to outlive Gitty.

## Pasting files into the work tree

The file tree accepts a paste, which means answering "what did the desktop put
on the clipboard when the user pressed copy in a file manager?" — a question
with no single answer. `src/main/clipfiles.ts` parses the three shapes that
turn up, in the order of how much each says: `x-special/gnome-copied-files`
(and the KDE/MATE/Nautilus spellings of the same thing), which is the only one
carrying the copy/cut verb; `text/uri-list` and macOS's `public.file-url`,
which carry paths and nothing else; and plain text as absolute paths, which is
what copying a path out of a terminal leaves. It is pure string work with no
imports so `test/clipfiles.test.ts` can hold the shapes without a clipboard.

Two things about that list are load-bearing. The plain-text fallback is
deliberately all-or-nothing — one line that is not an absolute path disqualifies
the whole payload, and `index.ts` additionally requires every path to exist —
because otherwise ordinary copied prose would read as a file list. And the
formats are **read rather than looked up**: `clipboard.availableFormats()`
reports the MIME types Chromium knows and leaves the desktop's `x-special/*`
ones out entirely, while `clipboard.readBuffer` returns them perfectly well.
Measured on this Wayland session; asking first would find nothing.

`file:paste` resolves its target against the root like every other path the
renderer names, and the sources never cross IPC — they come from the clipboard
in the main process. A name the target already holds is the one question worth
asking, and it is asked once for the whole paste rather than per file: keep
both, which is `copyName`'s `notes (copy).md`, or replace. Pasting into the
directory a file came from skips that question, being a duplicate made on
purpose. A cut renames, falling back to copy-and-remove across filesystems, and
clears the clipboard afterwards — leaving it would move the same files again
from a source no longer there. The count that comes back only decides whether
the renderer refreshes early; the watcher would get there anyway.

Which views offer it is the renderer's business (`contextMenus.ts`): the
changes and the working tree are the working directory, and a commit, a range
or a revision's snapshot describes something that is not on disk to write into.

## Running a snapshot's programs

`snapshotFiles` reads `ls-tree -r -z` rather than `--name-only`, for the mode:
`100755` is what makes a file a program at that revision, and the file tree
carries it as `exec` so the context menu can offer **Run in the Terminal**.
Browsing the work tree answers the same question with `stat` — the same call
that already checked the file was still there.

`snapshotExport` checks the commit out into a temp directory with
`git worktree add --detach`. The whole tree because a script reads its
neighbours, and giving it only itself would run the old program against today's
everything else; a **linked work tree** rather than an unpacked `git archive`
because a program in a repository asks the repository questions — `rev-parse`,
`describe`, what branch this is — and inside an archive every one of them
fails. The linked tree is a real one, detached at that commit with an index and
a HEAD of its own, so nothing run inside it can reach the checkout the user is
working in.

A tree over `MAX_SNAPSHOT_EXPORT_BYTES` (256 MB, in `shared/types.ts` because
the renderer names the number when it reports the refusal) is not checked out
at all. The size comes from `ls-tree -r -l`, which is git's record of the blob
sizes rather than a byte read from disk, and it is asked *before* anything is
written — a repository that carries its binaries or its vendored dependencies
would otherwise put gigabytes into `/tmp` on a right-click. A submodule prints
`-` for its size and counts as nothing, which is right: a checkout brings none
of it in.

The price is that this writes to the repository: a registration under
`.git/worktrees`. `worktree prune` runs first, which is what clears
registrations whose directories `/tmp` has since been cleaned of — without it,
the same snapshot after a reboot would fail on a name that is taken but no
longer there. The export is keyed by the hash and reusable; the `.git` file
inside the directory is what "already checked out and still sound" is read
from.

Main writes no processes for this. The renderer types
`cd <tree> && ./<file>` into the terminal pane **without the Enter**
(`runInTerminal(root, command, false)`), which keeps the act of running an old
program the user's own, and gives it a real tty for whatever it prompts for.

## Recent repositories

`src/main/recent.ts` keeps the list in `app.getPath('userData')` — which is why
`app.setName('Gitty')` runs before anything else, or an unpackaged run would
scatter state into `~/.config/Electron`. Reads filter out paths that no longer
exist, so a deleted repository disappears from the menu on its own. Remembering
is best-effort and never blocks opening a repository.

## One instance, or several

The window holds every repository as a tab, so the useful default is one
process per user: typing `gitty <repo>` in any directory should land a tab in
the window already open rather than start a second copy of the app. That is
Electron's single-instance lock. The launching process passes its repository as
the lock's `additionalData`, and the holder receives it on `second-instance`,
raises its window and forwards the path to the renderer, which opens it through
the same `openTab` the File menu uses — so an argument that is not a work tree
is reported the same way there too.

The lock is requested at module scope, before `ready`: Electron settles the
race between two launches at the moment the lock is taken, and everything after
it in startup must not run in a process that is about to quit — hence the
`quitting` flag the `whenReady` handler checks first. The Wayland scale
relaunch is safe alongside it because `app.relaunch` starts the new process
only after this one has exited, so the lock is free by then.

Which makes this the one preference the main process has to know before a
window exists, and so the one that cannot live in the renderer's
`localStorage`: `src/main/prefs.ts` keeps it in `settings.json` beside the
recent list. Changing it takes the lock or releases it there and then, so the
next `gitty` typed behaves as the setting now says. Taking it can fail — a
second window started while the setting was off still holds it — and then the
change waits for the next launch.

## Terminal

The pane splits, so ptys are kept in a `Map` keyed by a session id the renderer
mints (`src/main/index.ts`), and every `terminal:*` message names its session.
A disposed session goes silent so its exit notice cannot land in the terminal
that replaced it, and a reload disposes them all — the ids that could reach
them are gone with the old renderer.

`TerminalsPane` holds the split as a tree: a leaf is one shell, a branch shares
its area between children, and splitting the same way twice extends the branch
instead of nesting. Changing the set of children remounts its `Group` so the
panels share out evenly again, which is only affordable because **the xterm
instances live outside React** — the `sessions` registry in `terminals.ts` owns
the DOM node and the terminal (created by `ensureSession` in `TerminalPane.tsx`),
and the component merely re-parents that node. Unmounting a real xterm would
take the running shell with it, and every split moves terminals between panels.
Sessions therefore end only in `destroySession`: **Close**, a shell that exited,
or the tab's `TerminalsPane` unmounting (closing the repository tab).

## Refresh

`src/main/watcher.ts` watches the work tree recursively, filters `.git` down to
the few paths that matter (`HEAD`, `index`, `refs/`, …) plus build-output noise,
and debounces into a `repo:changed` event tagged with the root. The main process
keeps one watcher per open repository in a `Map`; closing a tab (`repo:close`)
stops that root's watcher. Each `RepoTab` reloads status and log only for its own
root. Watching is best-effort; the manual refresh path must keep working if it
fails.

The debounce narrows the burst but does not serialise anything: a refresh and
the next event can both be waiting on `git`, and the replies come back in
whatever order git finishes. Both `refresh` and `loadDiff` therefore stamp each
call with a sequence number and drop a reply that a newer call has overtaken.
Without it the panes disagree — the diff pane re-runs git for every render and
so always shows the truth, while a stale `git status` landing last leaves the
Changes pane (and the title bar's count) listing changes already committed.

## The window, and Wayland's scale

The window is created hidden and shown at its first paint, with the fallback
off `did-finish-load` that the Wayland note in `CLAUDE.md` explains. What it
does *not* do is choose a size against the screen: no clamp to the work area
helps with the problem below, and one was measured and taken out again.

A GNOME Wayland session with two monitors at different scales can leave
Chromium flipping the window's scale factor between them — measured here at
about thirteen times a second, between a `devicePixelRatio` of 1.203125 (an
external monitor at scale 1) and 1.50390625 (a built-in one at 1.25), each
carrying the desktop's 1.2 text scaling. Every flip changes the viewport by a
pixel and lays the page out again, so the interface shakes. It is not ours: an
empty `BrowserWindow` loading a blank document does the same, and it reproduced
on three launches out of three.

What was tried, and what it did:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `--force-device-scale-factor` | still flips |
| `--enable-features=WaylandFractionalScaleV1` | still flips |
| `--ozone-platform=x11` | steady, at a `devicePixelRatio` of 2.40625 — twice the size |
| a window small enough to fit the monitor | steady, but a clamped default still grew to fill it and flipped again |
| `--disable-features=WaylandFractionalScaleV1` | steady, windowed and full screen, at a `devicePixelRatio` of 1 |

So the last one is what the app sets — but not unconditionally: with it the
desktop's fractional scaling is ignored, which on a single fractionally scaled
monitor is a regression, the interface rendering smaller than everything around
it. It is worth having only where the flip can happen, which is where two
monitors are scaled differently.

That is knowable from `screen`, and `screen` needs `ready`; the switch is read
before Chromium starts, which is long before. The two cannot be reconciled in
one process, so `relaunchWithoutFractionalScale` starts a second one:
at `ready`, before the web server or any window, it compares the displays'
`scaleFactor`s and — finding more than one — calls `app.relaunch` with
`--disable-features=WaylandFractionalScaleV1` appended to `process.argv`, then
`app.exit(0)`. Nothing has been shown yet, so the restart costs a moment and
shows nothing. The repository argument survives because it is passed through
untouched, and `initialPath` skips `-` arguments anyway.

Three guards keep it from starting itself forever: the relaunched process finds
the switch already on its command line, `GITTY_SCALE_RELAUNCHED` is set in the
environment it inherits, and `GITTY_DISABLE_FRACTIONAL_SCALE` — `1` to switch
fractional scaling off whatever the monitors say, `0` to keep it on — takes the
decision away from the check entirely. The switch itself goes on
`app.commandLine` before `ready`, so it works for the packaged build as much as
for `run.sh`.

What it does not catch: a monitor plugged in after the app started. Relaunching
then would take the terminal panes' shells with it, so nothing happens
automatically and `GITTY_DISABLE_FRACTIONAL_SCALE=1` is the way to ask. And the
pid `run.sh` prints is the process that stepped aside, not the one now running.
