# File viewers

The panes that show a file rather than a diff — `CodePane`, `MarkdownPane`,
`ImagePane` — and the two outlines beside them.

## `fileView`

`fileView` swaps the diff for the file itself. It is deliberately **not**
persisted and is cleared whenever another file or commit is selected: a history
browser defaults to diffs, and viewing a file is an action (double-click, menu,
header toggle) rather than a mode to get stuck in. Snapshot mode forces it on —
a snapshot has no diff. Either way the source comes from `git.readWorking` in
the work tree and `git.snapshotFile` at a revision; `CodePane` renders it with
line numbers, and `MarkdownPane` takes over for `.md`.

## Highlighting

`highlight.ts` is shared by both. highlight.js is imported through `lib/core`
with languages registered one by one — the full bundle dwarfs the rest of the
renderer — and its token colours are mapped onto the app palette in CSS rather
than importing one of its themes. `highlightLines` exists because highlight.js
emits one blob whose spans run across newlines (block comments, template
literals): it walks the output keeping the stack of open spans, so each line can
be its own element without broken markup.

## The code outline

`src/renderer/src/symbols.ts` is the other outline — the declarations in a
source file, which `CodePane` draws beside it in the same `Group` shape
`MarkdownPane` uses for headings. It is pure string work over the text, for the
reason `main/patch.ts` is: a wrong outline does not throw, so
`test/symbols.test.ts` holds it. Comments and strings are blanked to spaces
first (columns preserved, or a `{` in a string moves the whole tree), nesting is
brace depth — indentation for the languages written that way — and a name
appears only where a keyword put it. Two conventions keep the loose patterns
honest: `member` rules match only inside a class, where a statement cannot
appear, and `guard` marks the rules with no declaring keyword in front of the
name, which are the ones `if (x) {` can fool. A language it cannot read
produces **no** outline rather than a guessed one.

It imports nothing, deliberately: `RepoTab` calls
`hasOutline(outlineLanguage(path))` to decide whether to draw the button, and
reaching into `highlight.ts` for that would drag highlight.js into the main
bundle — hence its own small extension table beside that module's.

Outline `Group`s follow the two rules every other `Group` follows (the id
carries the repository, and it is `disabled` while its tab is hidden). Sizes
live as long as the window — nothing in the app calls `useDefaultLayout`, which
is what react-resizable-panels v4 needs to persist them.

## MarkdownPane

markdown-it runs with `html: false` so raw HTML stays inert without a
sanitiser; heading ids are assigned on the token stream before rendering, so the
outline and the document cannot disagree; front matter is sliced off first,
since markdown-it would read `---` as a horizontal rule; and link clicks are
intercepted, because a plain `<a>` navigation would replace the whole app
window.

That interception is also where a link goes *somewhere*: an `http(s)` one to the
system browser, a `#` one to the heading, and — with Ctrl or Cmd held — a
relative one to the file it names, opened as a document beside the diff.
`resolveInRepo` decides what counts as in-repo (the same function the images
use, so a link and an image resolve alike, and anything climbing out past the
root resolves to nothing). The revision is the *document's*, not the view's: a
README read at a commit links to that commit's files. The `#fragment` rides
along in `FileDocState.anchor` and the opened pane scrolls to the heading whose
generated id matches it — once per document-and-anchor, or the images landing
later would drag the reader back up. A hover title says so, written onto the
token before rendering rather than onto the DOM after it — same reason as the
images — and never over a title the author wrote.

Prose can be marked as well as markup — proper nouns underlined by a language
analyser — through a `text` render rule fed from the main process. It is off by
default and has a spec of its own: `ref/spec/prose.md`.

## Images

Images are the one thing the renderer cannot resolve for itself: a relative
`src` would be fetched against the bundle, and a revision's bytes were never on
disk at all. `git.readImageFile` returns them as a data: URL (`ImagePane` for a
file opened on its own, `MarkdownPane` for the ones inside a document), keyed by
the same `rev` as the document, so a commit renders with its own screenshots.
The substitution happens **in the render pass** — the image rule reads a map off
markdown-it's `env` and re-renders once the fetches land. Patching `src` onto
the rendered DOM instead is the obvious thing and does not work: React owns that
subtree through `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` and rewrites it wholesale, silently
discarding the patch.

## The `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` subtree

Two consequences worth knowing before touching it.

**Memoise the prop object, not just the string.** React sets innerHTML whenever
the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` prop is a different object, so a fresh `{__html}`
literal per render rebuilds the nodes on every state change — the scroll handler
that tracks the outline was enough to do it continuously. The same applies per
line in `CodePane` and `BlamePane`, which is why both build their `{__html}`
objects in a `useMemo` beside the highlighted lines.

**Anything anchored into the document must survive that rewrite anyway** — which
is why find matches are painted with the CSS Custom Highlight API rather than
with `<mark>` elements — see *Finding text* in `renderer.md`.
