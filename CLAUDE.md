# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

It holds **rules only** — what to do, what never to do, and what to run. How the
program is built, and why, lives under `ref/spec/` (see
[Where the design is written down](#where-the-design-is-written-down)). Read the
relevant spec before changing a subsystem; do not re-derive it from the code.

## What this is

Gitty is an Electron desktop git history browser with four panes: the
uncommitted changes (top left, titled **Changes**), diff (top right), commit log
(bottom left) and an interactive shell (bottom right). See README.md for the
user-facing behaviour of each pane.

"Changes" and "Working Tree" are two different things throughout, and the
distinction is worth keeping in comments as well as on screen: **Changes** is
what is uncommitted, the `worktree` `View` mode; **Working Tree** is the whole
directory on disk, which is what browsing a null-hash snapshot shows. The
internal names (`worktree`, `WORKTREE_ROW`, `emptyWorktree`) kept the older word
rather than being renamed under the UI.

## Language

Two rules, and the line between them is *shipped UI* versus *the repository*.

**The interface is translatable.** Every user-visible string goes through the
message tables — never a literal in JSX or a dialog call. English (`en`) is the
source table: written first, and what every other language is translated from.

**Everything else is English, always.** Documentation, code comments, the
CHANGELOG, commit messages, `ref/spec/*`, this file. Conversation with the user
may be in another language, but nothing that lands in the repository is — except
the two things below, which are translations of English originals rather than
work authored in another language.

The user-facing documentation is two files. `README.md` is the short one —
what Gitty is, why it exists, how to install it, what it deliberately does not
do — kept under about 200 lines. `ref/readme/manual.md` is the long one: every
pane, the settings table, the shortcuts, the platform notes. A behaviour change
usually belongs in the manual; the README changes only when the pitch does. Both
have translations in `ref/readme/` — `README.<lang>.md` and `manual.<lang>.md` —
in eight languages (zh-CN, ja, ko, fr, de, es, ru, pt).

The translations are **snapshots, not a second source of truth**. Each carries
its translation date and a line saying the English file is the official version
and the only one kept current. Do not update a translation as part of changing
behaviour; the English file is what has to stay right. Because translated
headings would produce unpredictable anchors, each section carries an explicit
`<a id="…">` with the English slug, so the cross-links match the English file's.

Message tables other than `en` are the same kind of thing — translations that
follow, never lead. A new string is added to `en` and to the interface in the
same change; the other tables catch up afterwards.

## Commands

```bash
./run.sh [repo]          # build if stale, launch detached, print the pid
./run.sh --fg [repo]     # same but attached to the terminal
./run.sh --dev [repo]    # electron-vite dev with hot reload
npm run typecheck        # tsc over both tsconfigs
npm test                 # vitest over the pure modules in test/
npm run build            # electron-vite build into out/
npm run dist             # build, then electron-builder → release/ (.deb, AppImage)
./setup.sh               # symlink run.sh as `gitty` into ~/.local/bin
```

There is **no linter configured**. The automated safety net is `npm run
typecheck` plus `npm test`; **run both after every change.** The test suite is
one vitest file per pure module (`parse.ts`, `patch.ts`, `paths.ts`, `lanes.ts`,
`icons.ts`, `panes.ts`, `symbols.ts`), fed fixtures without a repository, so
`test/` is a readable index of what is tested. Anything that can be wrong *quietly* belongs there — the
patch builder above all.

A detached run writes everything to
`${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/.local/state}/gitty/gitty.log`; use `--fg` when you want
the output inline.

`npm run dist` is the *packaged* product and differs from the scripts above on
purpose: its own executable, so the desktop entry matches on `gitty` rather than
the `electron` window class, and the `.deb`'s postinst sets `chrome-sandbox` up.
`run.sh` and `setup.sh` are the developer path and keep both workarounds. Keep
`electron` in `optionalDependencies` — electron-builder refuses to package a
project that lists it as a dependency, and npm installs optional ones anyway.

`npm install` runs `install-electron && electron-rebuild -f -w node-pty` via
`postinstall`; both halves are needed. If the terminal pane fails to start after
an Electron version change, re-run that rebuild — node-pty must match Electron's
ABI, not Node's.

## Verifying changes visually

The UI cannot be checked by reading code, and this is a Wayland session where
X11 screenshot tools capture nothing. Screenshot it from inside Electron
instead: build, patch a `capturePage` call into `out/main/index.js` (the built
bundle, **never the source**) at the `ready-to-show` handler, run with
`GITTY_REPO=<repo>` and an env var carrying a delay plus an output path, then
read the PNG. Drive the UI first by passing a snippet to
`win.webContents.executeJavaScript` — clicking `.commit-row`, `.row` or header
buttons, or dispatching a `contextmenu` MouseEvent. `out/` is gitignored and
rebuilt, so the patch is throwaway. Use a repository with real history; this
repo's own log is short.

## Rules for changing code

**The process boundary.** `src/main/` owns everything privileged (git
subprocesses, the pty, the fs watcher, dialogs, clipboard, `shell.openPath`);
`src/preload/` is the only bridge, exposing a frozen `window.gitty` over
`contextBridge`; `src/renderer/` is pure presentation over that API, with no
node integration and no direct IPC; `src/shared/types.ts` is the contract both
sides import. **Adding a capability means touching all three**: an
`ipcMain.handle` in `src/main/index.ts`, a method in `src/preload/index.ts`, and
a type in `src/shared/types.ts`.

**Strings.** Add a string to the interface in `src/shared/messages.ts` and to
`en`; `npm run typecheck` then names every table that is missing it. Never reach
for a literal because a string is "obviously not going to be translated". A
message leaf is a string or a typed arrow function — no runtime interpolation,
no lookup by key. Because `msg` changes over a component's life, it is a
**dependency like any other**: every `useCallback` / `useMemo` / `useEffect`
that reads it must list it. Adding a language means a table beside `en.ts`, a
`Locale` in `locale.ts`, an entry in `messages/index.ts`, **and** a
`MainMessages` table in `src/main/messages.ts` — miss the last one and the menus
quietly stay English.

**Patches.** `src/main/patch.ts` is the one place a mistake is silent: a wrong
patch does not throw, it writes a wrong index. Read `ref/spec/main-process.md`
before touching it, keep it pure string work, and extend `test/patch.test.ts`
with every change. `DiffPane`'s line numbering must count exactly as `patch.ts`
counts — the `\ No newline` marker included — or a pick names different lines on
the two sides.

**Bundle size.** highlight.js and markdown-it may be imported only from the
`FileDoc` subtree, xterm only from `TerminalsPane`. A static import from a warm
chunk drags the library back into the main bundle. `paths.ts`, `icons.ts`,
`nav.ts`, `panes.ts` and `symbols.ts` are leaf modules and must stay
import-free; `terminals.ts` imports xterm **only as `import type`**. Full rules:
`ref/spec/lazy-loading.md`.

**Panels.** Every `react-resizable-panels` `Group` id must carry the repository
root and, where the child set varies, the visible set (`top-fd`, `bottom-lt`) —
sizes are stored per Group id. Every Group of a hidden tab needs
`disabled={!active}`: the library hit-tests every registered group, and a
`display: none` one reports a zero-sized rect.

**Preferences.** `App.tsx` owns every app-wide preference and persists it under
`gitty.*`. Read a stored number through the `num()` helper, never
`Number(getItem(…))` — an absent key is `null` and `Number(null)` is `0`, so the
fallback never runs. Options git or the pty needs (`DiffOptions`,
`TerminalOptions`) travel *with each call*; the main process holds no view
state.

**Things that must not be unmounted.** Full screen is a `position: fixed` class,
not a different tree, and hiding the terminal pane must not end its shells:
unmounting the layout would dispose the pty and kill whatever is running in it.
Terminal sessions end only in `destroySession` / `destroyTerminals(root)`.

## Gotchas

- **`react-resizable-panels` v4** exports `Group` / `Panel` / `Separator` with
  an `orientation` prop — not the v3 `PanelGroup` / `PanelResizeHandle` names
  that most examples and model priors show. Sizes are strings like `"55%"`.
- **`ready-to-show` cannot be the only thing that shows the window.** Under
  Wayland an unmapped window's renderer can withhold its first frame, which is
  precisely the frame that event waits for, so the app starts and never appears
  — the DOM is there, the compositor simply submits nothing. `createWindow`
  therefore arms a fallback off `did-finish-load`; run it under
  `--ozone-platform=x11` to see the event fire normally again.
- **StrictMode replays effects on mount**, so `gitty.roots` (the **Reopen last
  session** list) is persisted only when **non-empty** — one replayed effect
  writing `[]` erases the very session about to be reopened.
- **`min-width: 0`** on `.tab-content`, `.repo-tab-shell` and `.repo-tab`: a
  flex item defaults to `min-width: auto`, so without it a tab is stretched by
  its own nowrap content and its panel group ends up wider than the window —
  one pane squeezed to a sliver, another pushed off screen.
- **React rewrites a `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` subtree wholesale.** Memoise the
  prop *object*, not just the string, and never patch the rendered DOM
  afterwards — anything anchored into it (find highlights, image `src`) must
  survive the rewrite. Find matches therefore use the CSS Custom Highlight API,
  not `<mark>`.
- **TypeScript 7** removed `baseUrl`; path aliases must be relative.
- **vite must stay on 7.x** — electron-vite 5 peers on `^5 || ^6 || ^7`.
- **An unpackaged Electron app's window class is always `electron`.** Which is
  why `setup.sh` writes `StartupWMClass=electron` into the desktop entry: that
  string is what the window list and the dock match a window against to find
  its icon. `app.setName`, `--class`, `--name`, `--wm-class-class`,
  `CHROME_DESKTOP` and renaming the binary were all measured and all leave
  `WM_CLASS` — the Wayland `app_id` — alone; only packaging Gitty into its own
  executable would change it. **A Linux fact that does not generalise**: on
  macOS the name is already right, because the application menu is
  `{ role: 'appMenu' }` and Electron labels it with `app.name`, which
  `app.setName('Gitty')` has set before any window exists.
- **An application menu must exist.** Without one Chromium binds no edit
  accelerators at all and Ctrl+C on selected diff text silently does nothing.
  The menu bar itself is hidden (`autoHideMenuBar`). That menu is also why
  **Ctrl+C is not handled in the renderer at all**. The second copy chord,
  Ctrl+Shift+C, is ours (`copy.ts`, wired in `App.tsx`), because three different
  things hold a selection: the document, xterm and the HTML preview's iframe.
  `TerminalPane` must tell xterm not to pass that chord (and `Ctrl+Tab`) to the
  shell, which would otherwise arrive as an interrupt.
- **`app.setName('Gitty')` runs before anything else**, or an unpackaged run
  scatters state into `~/.config/Electron`.
- **Linux runs with `ELECTRON_DISABLE_SANDBOX=1`** (set by `run.sh`);
  `chrome-sandbox` cannot keep a root-owned setuid bit inside `node_modules`.
- The repository to open is resolved as `$GITTY_REPO`, else the first argv entry
  that is a directory (argv also holds the electron binary and the entry
  script), else cwd.

## Conventions

- Keep `CHANGELOG.md` current (Keep a Changelog format). Released versions are
  tagged `vX.Y.Z` with a matching GitHub release; put new work under
  `## [Unreleased]`, not into a published section. Releasing is: bump
  `package.json` (and the lock), close `## [Unreleased]` as the new version,
  bump the version in the README's **download links** — they name the file, so
  they go stale silently — and push the tag, which is what builds the packages
  and creates the release.
- Files under `ref/` — specs and any other standalone documents — are named
  with a date prefix: `YYYY-MM-DD-<name>.md`, so they sort by the day they were
  written and each carries its date in its name. Two exceptions: the README
  translations, whose filenames are globbed by README.md as `README.<lang>.md`
  and which record their translation date inside; and the subsystem specs listed
  below, which are living documents named for the subsystem rather than a day.
- Comments explain why, not what — the existing ones mark git format quirks and
  layout constraints that are not obvious from the code.
- A design decision worth keeping goes into the matching spec under `ref/spec/`,
  not into this file. This file grows only when a *rule* changes.
